                <pre>
                    This project, me and a group of 3 worked a Vision-Language Model where given an image, the model 
                    is able to give information on the image. Alongside that, it is able to answer questions regarding
                    the image with a good accuracy. In the project I worked primarily on the data exploration phase,
                    understanding the data our dataset contained, and instruction tuning, fine tunes the responses on 
                    a labeled dataset and outputs. This project taught a lot of the team work needed in a project and 
                    the importance of communication.

                <pre>
                    This was the final project for this course and we were tasked to create a portfolio using HTML, CSS, 
                    and JavaScript and have it be deployed onto GitHub for eveyone to see. This final project taught me 
                    a lot about bringing in the important concepts on HTML, CSS and JavaScript and putting it together to 
                    make something that has a tangible impact outside the scope of the classroom. It taught important skills 
                    that I can apply to, not only to this class but, my career as well.

                <pre>
                    This was a final project offered for ECE45. In this project me and my group were tasked in creating a synthesizer 
                    and using the concepts that we learned in the course. Using core concepts like Fourier Transforms, modulations, 
                    filters, and etc. My first instance working in a large group project, and learned core group communication. Also 
                    taught a lot about intricacies of the things I was learning. Furthermore, was my first expereince working with 
                    development of any sort of software that can be used by everyone.
